## 📌 Overview

Too often, great ideas and exciting opportunities die before they start – not for lack of passion, but for lack of people.  
Whether it’s a 5-player match, a hackathon team, or a study group, finding the right collaborators in time can be a challenge.  

Quick Teams helps solve this problem by connecting individuals quickly, so communities can thrive and events can reach their full potential.
